# Dance Dance

This is the github repository for our CG4002 Capstone Project. The sections below explains the various subcomponents of our code.

## Hardware Sensor

'hardware_sensor_final.ino' configures the MPU6050 sensors and processes the raw data into a more meaningful value (converting to appropriate units). A dance and position detection algorithm is also implemented using a circular buffer and determining the status of the user from a threshold. Accordingly, the accelerometer and gyroscope values from the sensors will be printed.
